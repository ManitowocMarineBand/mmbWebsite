Enjoy a night of classic cars and classic music with our annual “Cruiser Night” concert and car show.  The Marine Band will be playing classic oldies for you to sing along, and we’ll even have some car themed music.  Polish up your classic car, or just head to the park to enjoy our final concert of the season.
