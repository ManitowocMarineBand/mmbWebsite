The Manitowoc Marine Band is happy to be back performing live this summer! We will kick off the season by celebrating the traditional sounds of outdoor band concerts with marches, polkas, waltzes and a few new pieces! We will include two uniquely Manitowoc pieces of music, "MMB March" written by former MMB conductor Perry Susek, and "A Jubilant March", a piece commissioned for the 150th Anniversary of the City of Manitowoc.
