Corey Van Sickle is the director of the Manitowoc Marine Band for the 2018 season.  He received his bachelor's degree from UW-Eau Claire where he studied trombone with Dr. Philip Ostrander and conducting with Dr. Richard Mark Heidel.  Corey has been a music educator in the area since 2008.  He has taught at Roncalli High School, St. Francis Middle School, Manitowoc Public School District Summer Band Bash, and has taught numerous students privately.

Currently he performs on trombone and bass trombone with the Lakeshore Wind Ensemble, Generations Jazz Band, Newtonburg Brass Band, and the Eddie Larsen Dance Band.

Ginger Van Ells holds a BA from UW-Green Bay (1995), a MME (2014) from Silver Lake College and is certified in choral, instrumental and general music education.  Since 2000, she has worked for the Green Bay Area Public Schools as a music specialist spending the past 11 years in elementary.  Having played with the Marine Band for several years prior to starting a family, Ginger recently re-joined and is a member of the clarinet section, playing mostly bass but, you may find her filling in where needed throughout the band.  If she looks familiar, it may be due to the fact that she is no stranger to the stages of Manitowoc.  Missing only a few concerts in her 30+ years as a Lakeshore Wind Ensemble member, she has also been involved with Treehouse Theatre for the past several seasons, having music directed their most recent show.  Ginger is married to Brian and together they have 4 children.
