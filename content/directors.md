{{< img src="directors/GingerVanElls.png" class="right" alt="Ginger Van Ells" >}}

Ginger Van Ells holds a BA from UW-Green Bay (1995), a MME (2014) from Silver Lake College and is certified in choral, instrumental and general music education.  Since 2000, she has worked for the Green Bay Area Public Schools as a music specialist spending the past 11 years in elementary.  Having played with the Marine Band for several years prior to starting a family, Ginger recently re-joined and is a member of the clarinet section, playing mostly bass but, you may find her filling in where needed throughout the band.  If she looks familiar, it may be due to the fact that she is no stranger to the stages of Manitowoc.  Missing only a few concerts in her 30+ years as a Lakeshore Wind Ensemble member, she has also been involved with Treehouse Theatre for the past several seasons, having music directed their most recent show.  Ginger is married to Brian and together they have 4 children.
