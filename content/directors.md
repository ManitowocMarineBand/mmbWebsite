### Ginger Van Ells, Interim Director

{{< img src="directors/GingerVanElls.png" class="right" alt="Ginger Van Ells" >}}

Ginger Van Ells holds a BA from UW-Green Bay (1995), a MME from Silver Lake College (2014) and is certified in choral, instrumental and general music education.  Since 2000, she has worked for the Green Bay Area Public Schools as a music specialist and since 2007 has been enjoying teaching music at the elementary level.  Having played with the Marine Band for several years prior to starting a family, Ginger rejoined as a member of the clarinet section, playing mostly bass but you could find her filling in where needed throughout the band.  In 2018, Ginger moved into the Assistant Director's position and in 2023 was named Interim Director.  If she looks familiar, it may be due to the fact that she is no stranger to the stages of Manitowoc.  She has been with Treehouse Theatre since 2014 and the Lakeshore Wind Ensemble since 1987.  Ginger is married to Brian and together they have 4 children, who are all involved with the Manitowoc Marine Band, too.
